/* @docs
label: List Style

note: |
  List styling is not usually desired in navigation,
  but this also removes list-semantics for screen-readers

/* @docs
label: List Voiceover

note: |
  1. Add zero-width-space to prevent VoiceOver disable
  2. Absolute position ensures no extra space

/* @docs
label: Line Heights

note: |
  The default `normal` line-height is tightly spaced,
  but takes font-metrics into account,
  which is important for many fonts.
  Looser spacing may improve readability in latin type,
  but may cause problems in some scripts --
  from cursive/fantasy fonts to
  [Javanese](https://jsbin.com/bezasax/1/edit?html,css,output),
  [Persian](https://jsbin.com/qurecom/edit?html,css,output),
  and CJK languages.

todo: |
  - Use `:lang(language-code)` selectors?
  - Add typography remedies for other scripts & languages...
